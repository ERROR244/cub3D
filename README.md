My first RayCaster with miniLibX

# Summary
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable us to explore ray-casting. the main goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.\
Wolfenstein 3D is the ancestor of games like Doom (Id Software, 1993), Doom II
(Id Software, 1994), Duke Nukem 3D (3D Realm, 1996) and Quake (Id Software, 1996),
that are additional eternal milestones in the world of video games.
